Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction ðŸš¢

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning study aimed at predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. It was developed as part of a Kaggle challenge and follows a step-by-step YouTube tutorial.

Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on historical data. The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, visualize distributions, and identify correlations between features.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove irrelevant columns.

Pipeline Building: Create a consistent processing pipeline for data preparation.

Model Training: Train a RandomForestClassifier model to predict survival.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Use GridSearchCV with cross-validation to find the best model parameters.

Prediction Generation: Produce the final predictions for submission to Kaggle.

Dataset

The project uses the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle:
Kaggle Dataset Link

train.csv â€“ used for training the model

test.csv â€“ used for generating predictions

Requirements

Python libraries required:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Download train.csv and test.csv from Kaggle and place them in a folder named datasets in the project directory.

Open the notebook titanic_analysis_survival_prediction.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code).

Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
